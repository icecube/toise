The files Gen2_EHE_{NuE|NuMu|NuTau}_effective_area.npz hold the effective area
for a simple EHE analysis port to IceCube Gen2 using simulations with the
Sunflower 240m detector configuration and pDOMs as detector modules (essentially
IceCube DOMs with HQE PMTs).

The nu/nubar averaged effective area, given in m2, is binned in three dimensions:
    - True cos(zenith)
    - Energy at the detector volume
    - Neutrino energy at the surface

The binning scheme used is given in the npz file.
