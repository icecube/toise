The easiest way to install the Gen2 analysis package and its depedencies is
with `conda`. If you do not already have `miniconda` on your system, obtain the
installer from https://conda.io/miniconda.html, and install in a location of
your choice, e.g.:

  sh ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -p $CONDA_PREFIX

replacing CONDA_PREFIX with the prefix you chose.

Then, from the gen2_analysis source directory, create a new environment:

  $CONDA_PREFIX/bin/conda create -n gen2-analysis --file requirements.txt python=2 --channel http://icecube.wisc.edu/~jvansanten/gen2_analysis/conda --channel conda-forge

Now, activate the environment:

  . $CONDA_PREFIX/bin/activate gen2-analysis

and use `pip` to link the gen2_analysis package into your Python path:

  ICECUBE_PASSWORD=xxx pip install -e .

Replace xxx with the icecube user password. This will be used to download the required data tables.
